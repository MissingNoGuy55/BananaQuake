Some rage cards use double pixel clock than is calculated by the formula,
and I don't know how to recognize them, so if you have such a card, set
the option RageDoubleClock in the config file. And please tell me about
it, so I can try to diagnose.

Two new mouse types are supported: pnp (explained in gpm documentation),
and Wacom Graphire tablet.

nv3 driver is fixed to work on Riva128 again ( a = should have been a ==).
